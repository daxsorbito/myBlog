Hi, I'm Dax and a Software Engineer by profession. Married, no kids yet and love dogs.ðŸ™‚

I have a quest to learn more each day, to better myself than yesterday. So this blog would contain all of my Aha! moments in life, either it be technical or personal aspects in life.

This is more of my personal journal of things that enlightens me. But if you could get something from this, it would be an added personal gratification knowing someone has learned from me. ðŸ™‚
